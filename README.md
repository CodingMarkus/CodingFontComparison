# Coding Font Comparison

A collection of coding fonts and a HTML/CSS/JS based overview to easily compare them.

Just check out and open `programming_fonts_comparison.html` in your browser.

One of the fonts is a variation of the "Hack" font. If you want to create your own variation of it, check out my GitHub project which makes it very easy to do so by building the font from source inside a Docker container: [Docker Hack Font](https://github.com/CodingMarkus/DockerHackFont)
